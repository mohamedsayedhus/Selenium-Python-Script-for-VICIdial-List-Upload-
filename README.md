# Selenium Script for VICIdial List Upload & Configuration

This project automates repetitive administrative tasks in the VICIdial system using Selenium WebDriver. It loops through multiple list IDs to perform actions such as data uploads and form interactions efficiently. The tool reduces manual effort, enhances accuracy, and ensures consistent execution across all configurations.

# ðŸŽ¯ Goals
Automate repetitive browser-based operations within the VICIdial admin panel.
Loop through multiple configurations or records (IDs) and apply consistent operations.
Streamline the process of interacting with web forms and file uploads.
Reduce manual interaction with the system, saving time and reducing the chance of human error.

# ðŸŒŸ Benefits
Automation: Saves significant time by handling repetitive browser interactions using Selenium.
Scalability: Easily handles multiple list IDs or configurations by iterating over input values.
Error Reduction: Minimizes user mistakes in form submissions or file handling.
Integration Ready: Can be adapted for integration with Excel files and other data sources.
Cross-Platform: Works with any system that supports Python, Selenium, and Chrome WebDriver.
